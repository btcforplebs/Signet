    Network Security Configuration for Signet

    This app is designed to connect to a Signet daemon running on a
    Tailscale network. Tailscale provides transport-layer encryption
    via WireGuard, so cleartext HTTP is permitted.

    The daemon does not support HTTPS directly - it's designed to run
    on trusted networks (Tailscale) or behind a reverse proxy.
